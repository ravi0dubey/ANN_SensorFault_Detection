**Problem Statement** - ANN_TirePressure SensorFault_Detection
A tire pressure sensor fault means that there is a condition affecting the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) on the vehicle. Sometimes the light might come on to let you know there is a problem where the air pressure of a tire is too high or low. Other times, it means there is a fault with the system.
To predict the fault in air pressure system using Artifical Neural Network Deep Learning

**Solution**
1. Load the dataset
2.
